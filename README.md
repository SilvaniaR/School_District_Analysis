## Overview of the school district analysis: 
It appears that the state exams for reading and math shows evidence of academic dishonesty, for ninth graders at the Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they asked us to conduct an analysis by replacing the the math and reading score for Thomas High school with NaNs and to compare data before and after to see if there was indeed any alteratation of the academic grades.

## Results:
After carefully analyzing and comparing results between both analysis, we found no significant changes to the data. All the avereages stay the same wether data included the 9 th grade vs not the 9th grade data from Thomas High School.Therefore based on the this analysis one can conclude that there was no academic dishonesty at the Thomas High School. Below are images of the schools summary analysis, first image is the first analysis and second image is the second analysis; data without 9th graders.

Summary:
Four major changes that occurred to the a minor change of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. Due the removal of the ninth grade data from Thomas High School this caused a decresed in total student counts which also affects the average by a small point but not significant.
